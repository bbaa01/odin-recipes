        Steps
    </h2>    
       
        <div class = "list2">
            <p>
                Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
            </p>
            <p>
                Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium-high heat until browned, breaking it up into small pieces as it cooks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the skillet and cook until the onion is translucent.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Bring the sauce to a simmer and let it cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving. Garnish with chopped parsley, if desired.
